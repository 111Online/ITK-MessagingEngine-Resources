# ITK-MessagingEngine-Resources-Open

Resources for open source ESB project. 

This will be shared publicly, so should not contain any secrets.

The .jks files are blank, and need to be overwritten with appropriate generated/sourced certificates.

The config.properties file needs to have usernames and password updated accordingly - but should contain enough for you to get the project up and running.


The main project code is in a different repo, here: https://github.com/111Online/ITK-MessagingEngine
